# 1brc
Welcome to the 1 billion row challenge!

Yes, we realise the competition is officially closed. But we wanted to attempt it ourselves anyway. We will try to find the best solution we can that pure Python code can offer.

No third party libraries are allowed. Built-in libraries however are.

## Challenge Summary!
This is the challenge description as extracted from the original repo listed in the 'Relevant links' section.
> The task is to write a ~~Java~~ Python program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on stdout like this (i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit):  
```{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Abéché=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}```

It looks like each weather station is listed multiple times and in no particular order.

## How do I run it?
To be determined.
